                                       Acme::why?
    
    Why should I care about other languages?
    
    * Perl 5 and CPAN have benefited greatly by ideas borrowed from other languages
    * As have other languages from Perl and CPAN modules
    * When I new idea like YAML or JSON is released, massive duplication of resources takes
      place while different language implementors create their own:
        * test suite
        * parser
        * documentation
    * Testing, parsing, and docs in Perl 5 and 6 are different enough to consider them
      different languages
    * We can waste less time and create better software by sharing resources in a language-
      neutral way
