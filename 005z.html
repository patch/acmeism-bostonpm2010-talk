                                       Acme::who?
    
    Who thought up this wacky idea?
    
    Ingy d√∂t Net, a co-author of the YAML specification and creator of Kwiki, Jemplate, and
    Wikiwyg, among other projects, coined the term Acmeism and started the core projects
    mentioned.
    
    I attended his talk on Acmeism at YAPC::NA 2010 in Columbus, Ohio, and quickly fell in
    love with TestML, only to be further drawn in by the Acmeist agenda.
    
    We met up after the talk and have been collaborating and hacking on these projects
    since.
